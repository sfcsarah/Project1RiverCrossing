### Current project name:
##  River crossing puzzle game: the farmer with the fox, goose and cabbage

### Description:
  There is an eccentric farmer who needs to cross the river. He has a fox, a goose and a cabbage. He finds a really small boat that he can use to cross the river, but he can only carry one item at a time. He can't leave the fox alone with the goose, nor can he leave the goose alone with the cabbage, because he would prefer that the fox not eat the goose, and the goose not eat the cabbage.
  He would like to transport them across the river intact.

### Rules:
  1. Player 1 starts at the left bank.
  2. If you are on the boat at the left bank, it counts as being present at the left bank and vice versa
  3. When you click on the button for crossing the river, it counts as a move if valid, i.e. nothing gets eaten.
  4. If you click on the river crossing button, and its an
  invalid move, it will
    * alert you that your move is invalid
    * add 2 to your move counter
    * ask you to choose a different combination of who and what stays on the bank and what goes on the boat
  5. The game ends for player 1 if
    * the number of moves is all the way up to a certain max move i.e. moves < 15 (or some other number)
    * player 1 solves the puzzle and gets the farmer and his property across the river safely.
    * the number of moves taken by player 1, or "Player 1 lost" is displayed depending on player 1's performance.
  6. Player 2 now gets his/ her turn. (Also note that Player 2 should have not watched Player 1 try the riddle so that he/she doesn't get an unfair advantage.) Player 2 attempts to solve this riddle and plays until the game ends.
  7. Player 1 and Player 2's scores are compared.
    * The one who managed to solve it with the fewest number of moves wins
    * If neither party is able to solve the riddle, it's a tie.

## User stories

  * As a player I want the farmer, fox, goose and cabbage to be animated. I want to see the farmer move from the original river bank to the boat, and the boat to cross the river, and the farmer to leave the boat and get on to the destination river bank.
  * As a player I want to hear a sound when I click on the farmer or his property. It would be fun to hear the farmer say "Hey there" for the fox to make a 'woof' sound, the goose to make 'goose/ quack' sound and the cabbage to make a 'crunchy' sound.
